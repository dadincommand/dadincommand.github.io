So, picture this: it’s Easter weekend, the sun's (sort of) out, and we’d planned a big day out with the kids at the local pub. Before you raise an eyebrow—this place had bouncy castles, face painting, and not one but *two* celebrity rabbits: Peter Rabbit and the Easter Bunny. It was total chaos. The good kind.

My OH (other half) fancied a well-earned glass of wine, but with our youngest DD (darling daughter) still breastfeeding, we wanted to make sure it was safe before nursing again. We turned to Google, as you do, and found the guidelines—but when I tried to find an app to make things easier, every one I downloaded was either loaded with ads or wanted payment to unlock features.

**No thanks.**

So, I built my own.

By the end of that Easter Sunday—somewhere between egg hunts and inflatable wipeouts—I’d knocked together a prototype of what would become *Mamma’s Milk*: a clean, ad-free, totally free timer that helps breastfeeding mums figure out when it’s safe to feed after drinking alcohol.

We even tested it on the spot. OH gave it a go, liked it, and we've been fine-tuning it ever since.

You can try it out **right in your browser** before downloading—no install, no fuss:

Give it a whirl, share it with others, and let me know what you think. It’s made by a parent, for parents—simple, honest, and actually useful.
